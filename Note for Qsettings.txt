Let's break this down:

The QSettings object is created with two parameters:

"Lif3Snatcher's" is the organization name
"CODOptionsEditor" is the application name
These parameters determine where the settings are stored, which depends on the operating system:

On Windows: These settings are stored in the Windows Registry under: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Lif3Snatcher's\CODOptionsEditor

On macOS: The settings are stored in: ~/Library/Preferences/com.Lif3Snatcher's.CODOptionsEditor.plist

On Linux: The settings are typically stored in: ~/.config/Lif3Snatcher's/CODOptionsEditor.conf

The specific setting being checked and set is "app_launched":

If it's not set (first run), the warning is shown and the value is set to True.
On subsequent runs, this value will be True, so the warning won't be shown.
To find the exact location on your system:

For Windows: Open the Registry Editor and navigate to the key mentioned above.
For macOS: Look for the .plist file in the Preferences folder.
For Linux: Check the .conf file in the .config directory.
Remember, QSettings handles the file creation and management automatically, so you don't need to create these files or
directories manually. The settings will be created and stored the first time the application runs and sets a value.
